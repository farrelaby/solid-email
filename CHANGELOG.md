# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## 0.1.2 - 2026-06-21

### Added

- Added `compile()` and `compileSync()` APIs for pre-rendering reusable email templates and replacing dynamic slot data without re-running Solid SSR for every send.
- Added `Slot`, `slot()`, and `defineSlots<T>()` helpers for content slots, attribute slots, defaults, JSX slot values, and typed slot-name authoring.
- Added compile rendering benchmarks and expanded Solid Email skill documentation for cached template rendering.

### Changed

- Re-exported the compile and slot APIs from `@akin01/solid-email` so component consumers can import them from the package root.
- Bumped monorepo package, fixture tarball, and Solid Email skill versions to `0.1.2`.

### Verified

## 0.1.1 - 2026-06-21

### Changed

- Improved Solid email render performance by avoiding accidental `children` prop serialization and reducing repeated prop/style work in common components.

### Added

- Added rendering benchmarks for Solid Tailwind and React Email Tailwind templates.
- Added regression coverage for filtering Solid children out of native attribute props.
